# RecyclerViewDataBindings

After starting to use databindings with my Android projects where i need a RecyclerView, i had a hard time finding examples on how to get it all together. Most tutorials seem to focus on how to set up android studio and remove the findByIds, but not how to get the events up and running within the XML layout.

This is simple project to show how a RecyclerView content is set from XML after binding, and to show how event handlers can return params (in this case onClick) to decide which element was clicked.

Enjoy! :)
